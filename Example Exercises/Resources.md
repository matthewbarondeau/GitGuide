## Extra Resources
This section shall detail some extra resources available to you when using Git.

#### GitHub Education
As a UT student, you can get access to GitHub Education in which you are given unlimited private repositories as you work on your projects. You will need to send in a picture of your UT EID in addition to signing up since you keep your UT email long after you graduate. The easiest way to get this benefit is to get the student pack on GitHub which can be located here: https://education.github.com/pack

#### GitHub Resources
For some very basic functionality, GitHub provides a tutorial. This tutorial is meant to interface specifically with their site, so if you plan on using other tools or something different, it probably won't be of as much use to you. The tutorial can be found here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

#### Lynda Training Videos
Finally, if you decide that you absolutely adore Git and want to know even more about it, you are in luck. Lynda, which provides technical training videos, has several videos on how to use Git. These vieos are quite long and thorough so feel free to skip around. To access lynda, you should do the following:
1. Go to the following link and click the UT portal link.
2. Link: https://sites.utexas.edu/oe/ut-staff-professional-development/lynda-com-ut-portal/
3. The two videos that I have seen to be useful are "Git Essential Training" and "Git Intermediate Techniques". These videos total close to 9 hours of Git Training with accompanying exercises.
